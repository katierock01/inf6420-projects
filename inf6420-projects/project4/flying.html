		<p>There were twenty chieftains about the rostrum, and twenty swords flashed high in assent.</p>

		<p>There was no alternative.  That decree was final, and so Tal Hajus drew his long-sword and advanced to meet Tars Tarkas.</p>
		
		<h3>Habitat</h3>
		
		<p>The combat was soon over, and, with his foot upon the neck of the dead monster, Tars Tarkas became jeddak among the Tharks.</p>
		
		<p>His first act was to make me a full-fledged chieftain with the rank I had won by my combats the first few weeks of my captivity among them.</p>
		
		<p>Seeing the favorable disposition of the warriors toward Tars Tarkas, as well as toward me, I grasped the opportunity to enlist them in my cause against Zodanga.  I told Tars Tarkas the story of my adventures, and in a few words had explained to him the thought I had in mind.</p>
		
		<h3>Diet</h3>
		
		<p>"John Carter has made a proposal," he said, addressing the council, "which meets with my sanction.  I shall put it to you briefly.  Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, who was our prisoner, is now held by the jeddak of Zodanga, whose son she must wed to save her country from devastation at the hands of the Zodangan forces.</p>
		
		<p>"John Carter suggests that we rescue her and return her to Helium.  The loot of Zodanga would be magnificent, and I have often thought that had we an alliance with the people of Helium we could obtain sufficient assurance of sustenance to permit us to increase the size and frequency of our hatchings, and thus become unquestionably supreme among the green men of all Barsoom.  What say you?"</p>
