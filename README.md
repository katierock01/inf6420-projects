# INF 6420 â€“ Projects Hub

This repository contains the course site for INF 6420 by Katie Rock. It includes:

- A hub (`index.html`) linking to all projects
- A submission overview (`submission.html`) with grader-friendly links
- Project subfolders (Project 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, and a 2.3 placeholder)
- A docs hub (`docs/index.html`) and shared images/styles
- Small scripts for packaging and deployment

Large binaries (like DOCX/JPEG) are intentionally excluded from Git commits; upload them directly to the WSU server.
