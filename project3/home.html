		<p>"They really are," said the Lion, "but that doesn't make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy."</p>

		<p>So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side.  Toto did not approve this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws.  But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.</p>
		
		<p>During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey.  Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing.  This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret.  These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.  When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.  He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand.  The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong.  But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.</p>
		
		<p>"This will serve me a lesson," said he, "to look where I step.  For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak."</p>
		
		<p>Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it.  The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.</p>
