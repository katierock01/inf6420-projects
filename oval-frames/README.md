# Oval Frames Demo (EmpathTech)

This folder contains two ready-to-open demo pages that showcase oval-frame treatments for a portrait photo. The pages are set up so you can publish them with GitHub Pages or preview locally.

Files added:
- `oval-frame-comparison.html` — four oval styles (coral, deep blue, shadow, double rim).
- `linkedin-profile-variant.html` — LinkedIn-style profile card with deep-blue rim.

Quick steps to preview locally:
1. Download or copy these files to a local folder.
2. Put your image file named `photo.jpg` into the same folder (or the `oval-frames` folder if browsing from the repository).
3. Open either HTML file in a modern browser, or run a simple local server:
   - `python3 -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000/oval-frames/oval-frame-comparison.html`.

Publish with GitHub Pages:
1. Push these files to the `main` branch of the repository `katierock01/inf6420-projects` (they have been placed in the `oval-frames/` folder).
2. In the GitHub repository, go to Settings → Pages and enable Pages for the `main` branch and root (or `/docs` if you prefer). After a moment the pages will be available.

Expected published URLs (adjust if you publish from a different branch or folder):
- https://katierock01.github.io/inf6420-projects/oval-frames/oval-frame-comparison.html
- https://katierock01.github.io/inf6420-projects/oval-frames/linkedin-profile-variant.html

Notes:
- The HTML files expect an image named `photo.jpg` in the same folder. Upload your image to the folder in the repository or update the `img src` path in the HTML.
- Use sRGB exports and JPEG quality 80–90 for web.
