# Project 2.1 â€“ Research on the Impact of AI on Web Accessibility

Required filename and location (per rubric):
- Word document name: `rock-project2.1.docx`
- Server path: `html/inf6420-projects/rock-project2.1.docx`

Local development tip:
- Place the DOCX here locally so the Project 1 page link works before upload:
  - `INF6420-Projects/rock-Project2.1/rock-project2.1.docx`
- The Project 1 page already links to `../rock-Project2.1/rock-project2.1.docx`.

Upload steps (summary):
1. Connect to VPN (GlobalProtect).
2. Use SFTP (FileZilla/WinSCP/VS Code SFTP) to connect to your student web server.
3. Upload `rock-project2.1.docx` to `html/inf6420-projects/`.
4. Ensure your Project 1 page on the server links to `/html/inf6420-projects/rock-project2.1.docx` (your existing relative link will work if both pages live under the same site root). 
5. Test the link from your Project 1 page online.

Notes:
- Keep the DOCX as a Word file (about 8 pages, double-spaced). No AI-generated content per rubric.
- Include headings, tables, and lists where appropriate, and a References section.
